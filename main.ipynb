For extremely low first samples, participatns are even faster to respond, still consistent with the DDM. However, for extremely high first samples, participants are significantly slower to respond, which is inconsistent with the DDM. This seems like a \"too good to be true\" effect. This is not just due to fewer subjects at the extremes. I checked and most all subjects are seeing $\\pm 7$. SEs are wider at the extremes, hinting at more heterogeneous behavior, but it's significant still.\n",

Is it possible that decisions boundaries are adjusted after seeing the first sample? The equivalent process can be handled by a dynamic weight on evidence that adjusts thorughout the course of a decision. This dynamic weight would compress extremely large positive first samples. It could also do other things like change the weight on late vs. early evidence (see Choice Biases)."
